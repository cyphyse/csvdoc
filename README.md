# CSVDOC

This is a collection of tools to use CSV tables for storing markdown documents.
The library provides functions to split data points from YAML front matter
into columns of a table and backwards.
This ensures that all documents contain the
same data points in their YAML front matter.
This also helps to get a better overview of all data.
